# neovim

Here is my Neovim config.
It ain't much, but it's honest work.

This uses [NvChad](https://nvchad.com) as its base.

My goal is to be able to use this for work and school/personal writing.
Ideally, this means it would be compatible with Linux and Windows.

My plan is to take notes by hand and preferably collect them into Obsidian.
Homework will be done with Typst if it is only text or Quarto if it requires programming.
If I can call Typst from Quarto and have a consistent format, that would be cool.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/Steven314/nvim.git
```

## Languages

Things I commonly use that for which I would rather have functionality:

- [ ] R
- [ ] Python
- [ ] SQL

- [ ] [Typst](https://typst.app)
- [ ] [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)
- [ ] [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co)

## Rendering

- [ ] $\LaTeX$
- [ ] Quarto (PDF and HTML, at least)
- [ ] Markdown (live)
- [ ] Typst (live)
- [ ] R Markdown

## Plugins

I'm not sure yet.
We'll get there when we get there.

## Bonus Things

These aren't crucial, but would be nice to have.

- [ ] [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) integration 
- [ ] AI (using a local model?)
- [ ] Spellchecking for text and comments. I am bad with typos.
- [ ] Good keybindings that find my Moonlander keyboard macros and Colemak layout (but must remain good on QWERTY since I'll be using either layout depending on laptop or desktop).
